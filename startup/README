Daniel (даниил) Houston Project 5:

To Dr. Finkel:
    Your paths are included in my makefile you just have to uncomment them.

Bugs:
    None known everything works on all test files.  I emplemented assigning of globals, however I did not implement labeled for loops.
    

Java cup note:
    I finally found java-cup 10k so it should be compatible with all machines now.

Running:
    to run the file test.csx_go:
        make test
    to run anyfile in the test directory
        make inputfile file=<put_file_here>


Symbol Table: 
    I added a new method called globalOnly which checks to see if the only place a variable is declaired is in the global scope.
